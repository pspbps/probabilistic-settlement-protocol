# Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP)
## Whitepaper v1.0

---

## Version & Scope Declaration

This document defines **Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP) v1.0**.

This whitepaper is a **protocol-level specification**, not a business offering,
financial product, or application-layer implementation.

### Scope

PSP defines:

- Deterministic and verifiable probabilistic settlement rules
- Commit–reveal based randomness verification
- Protocol-level fee computation and non-retroactive governance constraints

PSP does **not** define:

- User interfaces
- Business logic
- Merchant policies
- Compliance, custody, or consumer protection mechanisms

Any application, platform, or service integrating PSP is solely responsible
for its own legal, regulatory, and operational compliance.

### Non-Endorsement

Use of PSP does not imply endorsement, approval, or partnership
by the PSP authors or contributors.

### Immutability of Finalized Outcomes

Once a settlement outcome is finalized under PSP rules,
it must not be altered retroactively by governance, operators, or integrators.

# Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP)
Version 1.0

---

## Abstract

The Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP) is a decentralized protocol specification for **verifiable, non-manipulable probabilistic settlement**.

PSP defines a deterministic, on-chain settlement primitive where the final settlement amount is selected from a predefined outcome distribution, using publicly verifiable randomness derived via commit–reveal mechanisms. Once finalized, settlement results are immutable and recomputable by any third party.

PSP is designed as a **protocol-level settlement primitive**, not an application, enabling integration across e-commerce, financial services, and digital marketplaces.

---

## 1. What PSP Is

PSP is:

- A **protocol**, not a platform  
- A **settlement-layer primitive**, not a product  
- A **verifiable probabilistic settlement standard**  
- Designed to be embedded into external systems  

PSP does **not** define:
- User interfaces
- Business logic
- Asset custody
- Application-specific workflows

It defines **how settlement outcomes are selected and finalized**.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

### 2.1 Deterministic Recomputability

Given the same public inputs:
- Rule definition
- Committed randomness
- Settlement amount
- Protocol parameters

Any observer can recompute:
- Outcome index
- Final settlement amount
- Protocol fee

No trusted party is required.

---

### 2.2 Commit–Reveal Verifiability

Settlement randomness follows a commit–reveal flow:

1. A commitment hash is submitted on-chain
2. Inputs are revealed later
3. The revealed data must match the prior commitment

This prevents:
- After-the-fact manipulation
- Selective outcome bias
- Hidden randomness sources

---

### 2.3 Non-Retroactive Finality

Once a settlement is finalized:
- Outcomes cannot be changed
- Fees cannot be recalculated
- Rules cannot be retroactively modified

Protocol evolution is allowed **only for future settlements**.

> **The protocol may evolve, but it must never change past commitments.**

---

### 2.4 Minimal Trust Assumptions

PSP assumes:
- Public blockchain execution
- Transparent contract code
- No off-chain trust

PSP explicitly avoids reliance on:
- Trusted oracles
- Proprietary randomness providers
- Off-chain adjudication

---

## 3. Settlement Model

### 3.1 Rule Definition

A **Rule** defines a settlement distribution consisting of multiple **Outcomes**.

Each Outcome includes:
- A settlement behavior identifier
- A probability weight (basis points)
- A parameter field interpreted externally

All outcome weights must sum to **10,000 bps**.

---

### 3.2 Outcome Selection

Given:
- A finalized random value
- A rule's outcome distribution

The protocol deterministically maps the random value to a single outcome index using cumulative probability traversal.

This process is:
- Deterministic
- Recomputable
- Non-interactive

---

### 3.3 Settlement Amount Binding

Settlement computation binds:
- Declared settlement amount
- Selected outcome index
- Protocol fee parameters

The protocol does **not** transfer assets.  
It outputs **verifiable settlement metadata**.

---

## 4. Randomness Model

### 4.1 Why Commit–Reveal Instead of VRF

PSP intentionally uses commit–reveal rather than external VRF systems.

Rationale:
- No dependency on third-party oracle networks
- Deterministic replay without oracle availability
- Lower systemic risk and surface area
- Suitable for protocol-layer primitives

Commit–reveal is sufficient because:
- The commitment is immutable
- The reveal is publicly verifiable
- Manipulation is detectable and rejectable

---

### 4.2 Trust Properties

Commit–reveal provides:
- **Unpredictability before reveal**
- **Verifiability after reveal**
- **Non-repudiation**

It does not attempt to provide:
- Perfect cryptographic randomness
- Entropy guarantees beyond adversarial detectability

This tradeoff is intentional.

---

## 5. Fee Model

### 5.1 Protocol-Level Fees

PSP defines protocol fees as:
- A fixed basis-point rate
- Subject to a hard fee cap
- Charged deterministically at settlement finalization

Fees are computed from:
- Settlement amount
- Current fee parameters

---

### 5.2 Fee Governance

Fee parameters may be updated only via:
- Explicit proposal
- Enforced timelock delay
- Non-retroactive application

Past settlements are never affected.

---
## Protocol Fee Model

The Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP) defines a protocol-level fee
mechanism that is deterministically bound to settlement finalization.

PSP does not charge for randomness generation or probability evaluation.
Instead, fees are assessed only when a settlement outcome is finalized
and verifiable on-chain.

## Fee Flow and Settlement Responsibility

PSP separates fee computation from asset execution.

During settlement finalization, the protocol deterministically computes
a protocol fee (`feeCharged`) based on the declared settlement amount and
current fee parameters.

This fee amount is:
- Bound to a specific invocation
- Publicly recorded on-chain
- Independently verifiable by any third party

The protocol does not enforce asset transfers. Instead, it establishes
an authoritative fee obligation that integrators are responsible for
settling within their execution context.

This separation ensures:
- Protocol neutrality across applications
- Verifiable fee enforcement
- Independence from frontends or custodial systems

Any application that utilizes PSP settlement logic implicitly accepts
the protocol-defined fee obligation as part of its settlement process.


### Fee Recipient and Governance

Each PSP deployment specifies a `feeRecipient` address, representing the
beneficiary of protocol-level fees.

In the initial deployment phase, the fee recipient is controlled by the
protocol maintainer and is subject to explicit governance constraints.

## Canonical Deployment and Protocol Identity

The Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP) distinguishes between
independent implementations and canonical protocol deployments.

### Canonical Specification

The authoritative definition of PSP is provided by:
- The PSP Whitepaper v1.0
- Published specification drafts and compliance documents

Any implementation claiming PSP compatibility must adhere to these
documents.


### Canonical Reference Implementation

The PSP maintainers provide a reference implementation for educational
and testing purposes. This reference code is non-production and does not
constitute a canonical deployment.

The canonical deployment of PSP is expected to occur on an EVM-compatible
Layer 2 network, following a testnet-first deployment strategy.

### Canonical Deployment

A canonical PSP deployment refers to an on-chain deployment that is
explicitly designated by the protocol maintainers as canonical.

Canonical deployments are expected to:
- Adhere strictly to the published specification
- Define an official fee recipient
- Publish immutable deployment metadata
- Serve as the default reference for tooling and integrations

The initial canonical deployment is expected to occur on an EVM-compatible
network, following a testnet-first approach prior to mainnet release.

Independent deployments may exist and operate freely but are not
considered canonical unless explicitly designated.

### Governance Constraints

All protocol fee parameters, including:
- fee rate (`feeBps`)
- maximum fee cap (`feeCap`)
- fee recipient address

are governed by a timelocked update mechanism.

Any proposed update must be announced on-chain and is subject to a
minimum delay period before becoming effective.

This design ensures:
- Non-retroactive fee enforcement
- Predictability for integrators
- Sufficient reaction time for users and applications

### Upgrade Path

The governance model is intentionally minimal in early stages and may
evolve toward multi-signature or decentralized governance mechanisms in
future protocol versions, without affecting finalized settlements.

## Canonical Governance and Upgrade Guarantees

The canonical deployment of PSP defines explicit boundaries between
governance authority and finalized settlement outcomes.

### Fee Governance

Protocol fee parameters, including:
- fee rate (`feeBps`)
- maximum fee cap (`feeCap`)
- fee recipient address (`feeRecipient`)

are subject to a timelocked governance mechanism.

All updates must be announced on-chain and are subject to a minimum delay
period before becoming effective.

### Non-Retroactive Guarantee

No governance action may retroactively alter:
- Finalized settlement outcomes
- Previously computed protocol fees
- Historical invocation data

This guarantee ensures that all commitments made at settlement time
remain immutable and verifiable.

### Upgrade Scope

Protocol governance may evolve forward through:
- Additional modules
- Extended settlement logic
- Alternative randomness sources

Such upgrades must preserve the non-retroactive guarantees of prior
protocol versions.

PSP explicitly disallows any form of post-hoc modification of user-facing
settlement commitments.


### Fee Calculation

For each finalized invocation, the protocol computes a protocol fee
based on the declared settlement amount:

feeCharged = min(amount × feeBps / 10,000, feeCap)

Where:
- `amount` is the declared settlement amount provided by the invocation
- `feeBps` is the protocol fee rate in basis points
- `feeCap` is the maximum fee limit per invocation

Both `feeBps` and `feeCap` are protocol parameters subject to governance
constraints and timelocked updates.

### Deterministic Verifiability

The protocol fee is:
- Deterministic
- Publicly recomputable
- Bound to a specific settlement outcome

Any third party can independently recompute the charged fee using
on-chain data, ensuring transparency and non-manipulability.

### Fee Recipient

Each PSP deployment specifies a `feeRecipient` address, representing
the beneficiary of protocol-level fees.

The protocol itself does not enforce asset transfer semantics. Instead,
it provides an authoritative, on-chain computation of the fee obligation,
allowing integrators to settle fees according to their execution context.

### Non-Retroactive Guarantee

Protocol fee parameters apply only to invocations finalized after the
effective update time. No finalized settlement may be retroactively
affected by parameter changes.

## 6. Governance and Upgradability

### 6.1 Parameter Evolution

The protocol allows:
- Fee rate updates
- Fee cap updates
- Fee recipient updates

Only for future settlements.

---

### 6.2 What Cannot Be Changed

The protocol **explicitly forbids**:
- Recomputing finalized outcomes
- Altering historical settlement results
- Reinterpreting committed randomness

---

## 7. Integration Model

PSP is designed to be integrated by:
- Payment processors
- Marketplaces
- Financial applications
- Digital commerce systems

Integrators are responsible for:
- Asset custody
- User interaction
- Business logic

PSP provides:
- Verifiable settlement outcomes
- Deterministic fee computation
- Public auditability

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Threat Model

PSP defends against:
- After-the-fact manipulation
- Selective outcome bias
- Hidden settlement logic

It does not defend against:
- Incorrect integrator usage
- Malicious front-end behavior
- Off-chain fraud

---

## Protocol Attribution and Badge Usage

Implementations that utilize the Probabilistic Settlement Protocol (PSP)
may optionally declare protocol usage through attribution or badge display.

Such attribution indicates that settlement outcomes are:
- Deterministically recomputable
- Derived from verifiable pre-commitment
- Governed by published PSP specifications

### Attribution Guidelines

Attribution or badge usage must:
- Reference the PSP Whitepaper and specification
- Not imply endorsement beyond protocol compliance
- Accurately reflect the implemented PSP version

The PSP protocol does not mandate attribution. However, public declaration
of PSP usage provides transparency and verifiability benefits to users
and integrators.

### Canonical Reference

The authoritative specification and reference implementation are maintained
by the protocol authors and published through official repositories.


### 8.2 Transparency Guarantees

All settlement-critical inputs are:
- Public
- On-chain
- Deterministically interpretable

---

## 9. Conclusion

PSP defines a new class of decentralized settlement primitive:
- Probabilistic
- Verifiable
- Non-manipulable
- Deterministically auditable

It is not an application.
It is not a business model.

It is a **settlement rule protocol**.
